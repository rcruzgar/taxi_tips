# Predicting Tips for New York City Taxi drivers

This project intends to build a machine learning model to predict the tip amount for the taxi drivers of New York City. This is the [original data source](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). The corresponding data dictionary can be found [here](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf).

The analysis is organized in 3 different notebooks. You will find all the steps and actions taken documented inside each notebook:

1. [Data Exploration and Cleaning](https://github.com/rcruzgar/taxi_tips/blob/master/Data_Exploration_and_Cleaning.ipynb): This notebook presents an initial exploration of the data set, cleaning the possible issues and removing outliers.

2. [Data Summary](https://github.com/rcruzgar/taxi_tips/blob/master/Data_Summary.ipynb): This is a brief report summarizing important data trends. It is targeted to a team of data sciencists.

3. [Model Building](https://github.com/rcruzgar/taxi_tips/blob/master/Model_Building.ipynb): This notebook implements and evaluates 2 different machine learning models.
